        <h2>What is Global Warming?</h2>
        <p>
            Global warming is a complex and critical environmental issue that refers to the long-term
            increase in Earth's average surface temperature. The Earth's climate is influenced by various
            factors, but human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial
            processes, have significantly contributed to the rise in greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide
            (CO2) and methane (CH4) in the atmosphere.
        </p>

        <p>
            These greenhouse gases trap heat and lead to a gradual warming of the planet, disrupting
            natural ecosystems, weather patterns, and sea levels. Understanding the causes and effects
            of global warming is crucial for developing strategies to mitigate its impact and adapt to the
            changing climate.

    <section id="causes">
        <h2>Causes of Global Warming</h2>
        <p>
            The primary causes of global warming are rooted in human activities that release large
            quantities of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. The burning of fossil fuels, such as coal,
            oil, and natural gas, for energy production is a major contributor. This process releases
            significant amounts of carbon dioxide, the most prevalent greenhouse gas.
        </p>

        <p>
            Deforestation is another critical factor. Trees absorb CO2 as part of photosynthesis, and when
            forests are cleared, this natural carbon sink is diminished. Additionally, industrial processes,
            such as manufacturing and cement production, release various pollutants that contribute to
            the greenhouse effect.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="effects">
        <h2>Effects of Global Warming</h2>
        <p>
            The effects of global warming are far-reaching and impact various aspects of the Earth's
            climate system. Rising temperatures contribute to the melting of polar ice caps and glaciers,
            leading to a rise in sea levels. This poses a significant threat to coastal communities and
            low-lying areas, increasing the risk of flooding and erosion.
        </p>

        <p>
            Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns also result in more frequent and intense
            extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, droughts, and heatwaves. These events can have
            devastating consequences for ecosystems, agriculture, and human populations.
        </p>

        <p>
            Furthermore, global warming contributes to shifts in biodiversity and ecosystems. Some species
            may struggle to adapt to new conditions, leading to disruptions in food chains and loss of
            habitat. Coral reefs, crucial for marine biodiversity, are particularly vulnerable to
            temperature increases, causing coral bleaching and die-offs.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="prevention">
        <h2>Preventing Global Warming</h2>
        <p>
            Addressing global warming requires concerted efforts at individual, community, and global levels.
            One key strategy is transitioning to renewable energy sources. Solar, wind, and hydropower are
            sustainable alternatives that significantly reduce carbon emissions compared to fossil fuels.
        </p>

        <p>
            Reforestation and afforestation play a crucial role in carbon sequestration. Planting trees
            helps absorb CO2 from the atmosphere and promotes biodiversity. Sustainable land-use practices
            and protecting natural carbon sinks, such as forests and wetlands, are essential components of
            prevention strategies.
        </p>

        <p>
            International cooperation and policies that promote environmental sustainability are vital.
            Supporting and implementing agreements like the Paris Agreement can set the stage for collective
            action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and limit global temperature increases.
        </p>

        <p>
            Additionally, individual choices, such as reducing energy consumption, minimizing waste, and
            advocating for sustainable practices, contribute to the broader effort in preventing global warming.
            Education and raising awareness about the consequences of climate change empower individuals to make
            informed decisions and participate in the global movement for a sustainable future.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="take-action" class="cta">
        <h2>Take Action Today!</h2>
        <p>
            The urgency of addressing global warming requires immediate action. Individuals, communities,
            businesses, and governments all play crucial roles in mitigating the impact of climate change.
            Consider making sustainable choices in your daily life, supporting initiatives that promote
            environmental conservation, and advocating for policies that prioritize a low-carbon future.
